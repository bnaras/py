## The format of this csv file is as follows, in 3 columns
##
## full_name, sunet, role
##
## Note that we need the _sunet_ not the email prefix; i.e.,
## foo.bar@stanford.edu might be a valid email address but
## the sunet id is not foo.bar! 
##
## Allowable choices for roles are student or instructor.
## No other values are allowed. Case matters.
##
## Note also how things are quoted.
##
## The header line that follows here should be left alone
"Name","Sunet","Role"
"Blow, Joe", "foobar", "instructor"
